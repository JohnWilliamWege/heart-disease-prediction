# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning application that predicts heart disease presence based on medical attributes. The application utilizes a dataset containing various medical parameters that might influence heart disease, processes the data, and applies a predictive model.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualization of categorical variables based on the target variable)
- Machine Learning Model Integration for predicting heart disease
- User Interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following attributes:
- Age: The person's age in years
- Sex: The person's sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
- CP: Chest pain type ([value1, value2, value3, value4])
- Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- Chol: Serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- FBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
- Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results ([values])
- Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- CA: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
- Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
